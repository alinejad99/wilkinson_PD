Wilkinson Power Divider Design and Simulation
In this repository, we design and simulate a Wilkinson power divider with a 2:1 power division ratio at a central frequency of 8 GHz using microstrip lines. The input and output ports are assumed to have an impedance of 50 ohms. We will use 90-degree bends to connect the lines.

Tasks
a) Draw the schematic diagram of the Wilkinson power divider.

b) Plot the parameter S11 in dB over the frequency range from 1 to 10 GHz and report the bandwidth for a 20 dB return loss.

c) Plot the curves of parameters S21 and S31 in dB over the frequency range from 1 to 10 GHz on a single graph.

d) Plot the phase curves of parameters S21 and S31 over the frequency range from 1 to 10 GHz on a single graph.

e) Plot the parameter S22 and S33 in dB over the frequency range from 1 to 10 GHz.

f) (Optional) Upgrade the Wilkinson power divider to a 4:1 power divider, draw the schematic diagram, and plot the parameters S21, S31, S41, and S51 in dB over the frequency range from 1 to 10 GHz.

g) (Optional) Plot the phase curves of parameters S21, S31, S41, and S51 over the frequency range from 1 to 10 GHz.

Feel free to use appropriate simulation tools and software to conduct these simulations and visualize the results.
